# Spring Framework Learning Project

This repository contains examples and projects demonstrating fundamental Spring concepts, including **Spring Annotations**, **Spring Bean Scopes**, and **Autowiring**. The purpose of this project is to practice and deepen understanding of the Spring Framework's core features.

## Key Concepts

- **Spring Annotations**: Simplify configuration by using annotations such as `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, and `@Controller` to define Spring beans.
- **Spring Bean Scopes**: Manage the lifecycle and scope of beans with annotations like `@Scope("singleton")` and `@Scope("prototype")`.
- **Autowiring**: Automatically inject dependencies using `@Autowired`, enabling the Spring container to resolve and inject collaborating beans.

## Project Structure

- **Annotations Demo**: Demonstrates the use of various Spring annotations for bean creation and management.
- **Bean Scopes Demo**: Example project to showcase different bean scopes in Spring.
- **Autowiring Demo**: Illustrates the use of Autowiring to inject dependencies.

## How to Run
